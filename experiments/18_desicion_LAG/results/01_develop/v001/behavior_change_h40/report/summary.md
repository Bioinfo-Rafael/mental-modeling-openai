- Classification metrics above use valid outputs only; errors, pending counts and error-as-miss metrics are in summary.json.
- Cost is a usage-based estimate, not an invoice. Unknown-cost attempts are reported separately; null is not zero.
- Step matching requires the same aircraft and is one-to-one. Exact and ±tolerance metrics are both saved.
- Binary event coverage is only an overlapping-window proxy. Localization and duplicate counts require diagnostic output.
- Reasons are for manual review; no automatic score claims that a tactical interpretation is correct.
- Single episode reused for development and evaluation; not a held-out test.
- Unannotated windows are weak negatives, not verified absence of important events.
- Window-wide retrospective detection, not future-event prediction.
